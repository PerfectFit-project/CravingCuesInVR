# Craving Cues in VR

## Goals
1. Develop a tool to create personalized virtual reality environments to elicit smoking cravings.
2. Develop UI to allow researchers to communicate with participants during the experiment.

## (Rough) Plan
1. Develop UI and implement networking to facilitate communication between researcher and participant interfaces.
2. Integrate virtual environment functionality.

### Progress Status
Researcher and participant UI complete in terms of basic local functionality (no communication between them).

### Use
In the present state, open as Unity project, enable the desired GameObject components on the project hierarchy to view the relevant UI, and enter Play mode to test functionality.
